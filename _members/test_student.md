I am an Assistant Professor in the Computational Intelligence Group at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Here, I am working on multiple different topics in the field of robot learning, primarily in the area of deep reinforcement learning.

One area of particular interest of mine is the combination of deep reinforcement learning with evolutionary principles, for the development of AI-assisted design methodologies and physical/embodied intelligence, to allow robots to co-adapt both their behaviour and morpoholgy.

Before I joined Amsterdam I worked as postdoctoral researcher at the Aalto University and the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence in Espoo (Helsinki), Finland.
